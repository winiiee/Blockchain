**# a)What is the importance of blockchain?**

The importance of new blockchain technology is described in the following points:

**1) Decentralization**

Removal of a centralized system where one institution or middleman was responsible for the user's database where they used to take control of the user information, perform the required work, etc

**2)No Tampering** (to interfere, harm, or have unauthorized access to any system)

Difficult to interfere and alter some of the information of a block, as each block is interlinked with each other )

if a hacker alters the data of one block, a new hash is formed which in turn makes the block above an invalid one, where other people in the network can easily sense it and be aware of the unknown changes that have occurred in the network

**3)Transparency**

Since blockchain is also known as a public digital ledger, all people in the network have a copy of every transaction detail, so every person knows about the new things added in the block or any updates to the block
