# a)What is the importance of blockchain?**

The importance of new blockchain technology is described in the following points:

**1) Decentralization**

Removal of a centralized system where one institution or middleman was responsible for the user's database where they used to take control of the user information, perform the required work, etc

**2)No Tampering** (to interfere, harm, or have unauthorized access to any system)

Difficult to interfere and alter some of the information of a block, as each block is interlinked with each other )

if a hacker alters the data of one block, a new hash is formed which in turn makes the block above an invalid one, where other people in the network can easily sense it and be aware of the unknown changes that have occurred in the network

**3)Transparency**

Since blockchain is also known as a public digital ledger, all people in the network have a copy of every transaction detail, so every person knows about the new things added in the block or any updates to the block




# b)Explain different types of consensus(generally accepted agreement/decision among a group of peoples) mechanism

First, What is a consensus mechanism  

for eg, if a group of friends decides to play any game, they all should agree upon one game that everyone wants to play without having any one person decide the game to be played

Just like that Consensus mechanism is like a set of rules that helps computers in a network agree upon the correct transactions done without depending upon a certain third person or any central authority. ( validity of transactions)

Different types of consensus mechanisms are as follows:

**1)Proof of Work (POW)**

Use of computational power to verify cryptocurrency  transactions done by solving mathematical problems and adding them to the block

**2)Proof of Stake**

It reduces the computational power used by miners to validate cryptographic transaction 

validators are chosen based on the number of staked coins they have

The owners offer their coin as collateral(providing something to the lender as a guarantee of repayment) - staking as a chance to validate transactions and earn rewards

In Ethereum, 32ETH is required to be staked before a user can operate a node
